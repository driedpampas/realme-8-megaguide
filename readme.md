# [EXTRA] Getting fastboot access
<p><img src="https://dummyimage.com/1000x70/ffffff/FF0000?text=Do this ONLY AFTER UPDATING to desired RUI3 version (ex: C.18)"></p>

## You will need [oplus-unlock](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/oplus-unlock)

1. Go back to the [MTK Client](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) folder
2. Open the console again in `MTK Client` folder, **a tip how to do it faster below**

5. MTK Client should output something like this:
      <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KDp2u5O.png"></p>
6. Run  the command `python mtk r lk lk.bin`. There will now be a `lk.bin` file in **MTK Client** folder.
7. Download [oplus-unlock](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/oplus-unlock) and extract it.
8. Open the console in **oplus-unlock** folder, **a tip how to do it faster below**
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/J5VAWoy.png"></p>
9. Move `lk.bin` to oplus-unlock folder.
10. Run command `python oplus-unlock lk.bin -o patched.bin`. A `patched.bin` file will be created. Move it to **MTK Client** folder.
11. Run command `python mtk w lk patched.bin`

### Now flash whatever custom rom you want. 

# [EXTRA] Installing  a Custom ROM

## Prerequisites
- [platform-tools]( https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
- [ADB Driver Installer](https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=4623157&d=1540039037) - fastboot drivers
- recovery image (usually `recovery.img`)
- vbmeta image (usually `vbmeta.img`)
- a custom rom package (in this guide I used Leaf OS 2)

1. ## Rebooting to fastboot
	1. Open a command prompt window in the **platform-tools** folder.
  	2. Enable Developer Options on device and enable USB Debugging.
	3. In the platform-tools folder open a command prompt and run `adb devices`. You will see something like this on phone, check `Always allow...` and hit `Allow`.
 	4. In the command prompt run `adb reboot boootloader`. Phone will reboot to a screen that says `fastboot_verify_ok` or similar.

2. ## Installing custom recovery and sideloading custom rom
	1. Move the `recovery.img` and `vbmeta.img` files to the **platform-tools** folder.
 	2. Run the command `fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta vbmeta.img`. It should show 
		<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bQ3BS4L/image.png"></p>
 	3. Run the command `fastboot flash recovery recovery.img`:
		<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/L9YZXdn/Screenshot-from-2023-08-02-11-41-25.png"></p>
	4. Now, reboot to recovery mode with the command `fastboot reboot recovery`
		<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Y0B19X6/Screenshot-from-2023-08-02-11-41-34.png"></p>
	5. In recovery, go to `Factory reset > Format data/factory reset > Format data`. **After** factory reset go back and select `Apply update > Apply from ADB`. You should see this when running `adb devices`:
 		<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/znj0gVk/image.png"></p>
   	6. Now run the command `adb sideload custom-rom.zip` (replace *custom-rom.zip* with custom rom package name). For example I flashed LeafOS 2:
		<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3B0Xv7x/Screenshot-from-2023-08-02-11-38-48.png"></p>
  	7. <u>**Optional**</u> *ONLY* if  it is specified / needed to sideload a gapps package. Select `Apply update > Apply from ADB` again and run `adb sideload gapps.zip` (replace *gapps.zip* with package name). 
		<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XXj5CVx/image.png"></p>
	### If you get a "Signature verification error" continue anyways, the package will still flash, this goes the same to any other ZIPs you flash.
  	9. Once finished, in the recovery go back to `Reboot system now`. The phone will reboot into your Custom ROM.

# [EXTRA] Rooting (I used Lineage OS 20.0 for this)
<p><img src="https://dummyimage.com/400x100/ffffff/FF0000?text=ONLY USE ONE METHOD"></p>


## 1. With Magisk

Thanks for reading, written by [lemonek](https://t.me/lemonekq/) with ๐. Adapted by [me](t.me/driedpampas) also with ๐.

**ยน** More info on the orange-state indicator and other indicators:
   -  Green state means the device is locked, it shouldnt show that it's locked on-boot
   -  Yellow state means that an alternate keystore was used to verify the boot image
   -  Orange state indicates that the device is unlocked.
   -  Red state means that a device in the locked or verified state had a boot image that did not verify.
