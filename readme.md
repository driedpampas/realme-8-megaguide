   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mMKRfRG.png"></p>
7. After installing, **Leave your phone shut down**. We will get into the same state in downgrading to RUI2

# 3. Downgrade to RUI2
1. **Extract** and enter to the folder of [MTK Client archive](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Open the console in the [MTK Client's](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) folder, **a tip how to do it faster below**
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/J5VAWoy.png"></p>
3. Run the payload by simply using command `python mtk payload`, It should look like this: 
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y2mwRhR.png"></p>
   If there is any error with python, you dont have the libaries. get them using command `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
4. Make sure your phone is powered off, Make sure your phone is connected to your computer, as it is: Hold down **Vol+, Vol-, and power button** - **(Don't leave the buttons until the bypass is done)**
5. MTK Client should output something like this:
      <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KDp2u5O.png"></p>
   
6. Leave the phone alone in the BROM, Run the [SP Flash tool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sfsm3EXhIf8TrS5Y-En1mifgg8e9VjXl/view?usp=drive_link) [flash_tool.exe]
7. Click on `Options > Option...`
8. Make sure the right **COM Port** is selected, UART enabled and baud rate is set to 921600.
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/C6n8awx.png"></p>
   
9. Get [Haadi's A.24 RUI2 Firmware](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OvT-YYBdJMBmV87C0f1ThcCKmvKvqvi7/view?usp=share_link) and unpack it
   
10. Load scatter from Haadi's Firmware
    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tzavwau.png"></p>
<p align="center" style="color: red;">IMPORTANT: </p><p align="center">Remember to uncheck:<br>
- opporeserve2 [IMEI] <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sIiT7t8.png"><br><br>
- cdt_engineering [CODES??] <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wfAfnCn.png">
</p>
11. Remember to have download only mode **Without authenticator**
    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0xFJVuo.png"></p>
12. Place your phone on a stable surface, to not disconnect anything. This process will take up to 15-20 minutes, to get A.24 on your phone, click `Download`
    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tJiKdLf.png"></p>
13. If anything will not fail, it should look like this
    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QhJ6fVi.png"></p>

14. Before doing anything, remember to **WIPE down your phone for safety.** Hold down **Vol-, and power button**, In recovery select wipe data, and then **don't** select the option to retrieve contacts, etc. It will cause errors, select the clean wipe. **Act as you had RUI2 from the beggining LOL**

# 4. Unlocking the bootloader - OFP Partitions
1. Open the console in the [MTK Client's](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) folder
	1. Run the payload **again** by using command `python mtk payload`
	2. Do what before:  Make sure your phone is powered off, Make sure your phone is connected to your computer, as it is: Hold down **Vol+, Vol-, and power button** - **(Don't leave the buttons until the bypass is done)**
	3. Check if output of [MTK Client](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) was same as before, if it is then payload was sent successfully
4. Leave the phone alone in the BROM, Run the [SP Flash tool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sfsm3EXhIf8TrS5Y-En1mifgg8e9VjXl/view?usp=drive_link) again [flash_tool.exe]
5. Click on `Options > Option...`
6. Make sure the right **COM Port** is selected, UART enabled and baud rate is set to 921600.

7. Things are now getting a bit different. Download and extract [Decrypted OFP Partitions](https://mega.nz/file/UChygSgS#2LdGZ0JPD5KpIYXNbCkCvy7ZefsenBr4oU4CE8p9lDM)
8. Select the scatter from [Decrypted OFP Partitions](https://mega.nz/file/UChygSgS#2LdGZ0JPD5KpIYXNbCkCvy7ZefsenBr4oU4CE8p9lDM)
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gjODF8q.png"></p>
9. These things should be only selected. If aren't, you have selected the wrong OFP/Firmware/Scatter
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CA4f7YG.png"></p>
10. Check if mode is `Download Only`, if so: click `Download` button. Remember to also put your phone in a stable location.
    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tJiKdLf.png"></p>

# 5. Unlocking the bootloader - MTK Client
1. Install [USBDk](https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk/releases/)
2. Open the console third time in the [MTK Client's](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) folder
4. Reboot your device, turn it off and Hold down **Vol+, Vol-, and power button** - **(Don't leave the buttons until the bypass is done)**
5. Type `python mtk e metadata,userdata,md_udc` - This command wipes your data. It should look like this:
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/olGdWYp.png"></p>
6. Unlock the bootloader using command `python mtk da seccfg unlock`, the output should look like this
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qezn6Af.png"></p>
      
   **After this, unlock your phone. First boot will take up to 5-20 minutes. Don't panic.**
      
   Bootloader is unlocked, **When you will boot your device, press one time power button to skip dm-verity**, there also will be a 5-second orange-state indicator
      
   -  Green state means the device is locked, it shouldnt show that it's locked on-boot
   -  Yellow state means that an alternate keystore was used to verify the boot image
   -  Orange state indicates that the device is unlocked.
   -  Red state means that a device in the locked or verified state had a boot image that did not verify. 

7. You can boot into RUI2, in order to setup it for updating into C.18, Currently there will be three updates. `[A.24] > C.07 > C.14 > C.18` **TIP: Remove your sim card, and don't connect temporarily to any networks to avoid longer OOBE times** 

<p align="center" style="color: #909090">Congrats, you now have a unlocked phone with the latest version of RUI3!<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z90bwAU.png"></p>
