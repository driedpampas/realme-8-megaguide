# II. Installing a Custom Recovery and ROM

## Prerequisites

| Software | Drivers | Images |
| :------: | :-----: | :----: |
| [latest platform-tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) | [QcomMtk-Driver](https://www.mediafire.com/file/nninaiiqy1e5csa/New+QcomMtk_Driver_Setup_V2.0.1.1_GsmMafia.Com.exe) | [vbmeta image](https://github.com/bengris32/releases/releases/download/arrow-1.1/vbmeta.img) |

| Custom ROM | GApps Package | Recovery |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :------: |
| check out the [Telegram group](https://t.me/Realme8AOSPGroup) | [MindTheGApps for Android 13](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=4279422670115734716) | [recoveries page](/md/recovery.md) |

## 1. Installing custom recovery

1. Go back to the folder of [MTK Client](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Open the console again in [MTK Client's](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) folder
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RJtobaI.png"></p>
3. Send the payload with `python mtk payload`. It should look like this:
   <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WSQsVj1.png"></p>
4. Make sure your phone is powered off, hold down both **Vol+, Vol-** and connect the usb cable.
5. Run `python mtk w vbmeta vbmeta.img` to flash the vbmeta image.
6. Run `python mtk w recovery recovery.img` to flash the custom recovery you downloaded from the [recoveries page](/md/recovery.md). Your phone might reset itself.
7. Run `python mtk reset`. After the phone reboots contiue to the next step.

## 2. Sideloading custom rom

1.  Open a command prompt window in the **platform-tools** folder.
2.  **On your phone**, enable Developer Options and enable USB Debugging.
3.  In the platform-tools folder open a command prompt and run `adb devices`. You will see `Allow USB Debugging for ...` on phone, check `Always allow...` and hit `Allow`.
4.  In the command prompt run `adb reboot recovery`. 

5.  In recovery, go to `Factory reset > Format data/factory reset > Format data`. **After** factory reset go back and select `Apply update > Apply from ADB`. You should see this when running `adb devices`:
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MoiIS9k.png"></p>

6.  Now run the command `adb sideload custom-rom.zip` (replace _custom-rom.zip_ with custom rom package name). For example I flashed LeafOS 2:
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QZqi1e1.png"></p>

7.  **ONLY** do this step on custom roms **WIHTOUT GAPPS / GMS** (check the rom's description to check). Select `Apply update > Apply from ADB` again and run `adb sideload gapps.zip` (replace _gapps.zip_ with package name).
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DUEMXrn.png"></p>

#### If you get a "Signature verification error" on your phone, click `Yes` to continue anyways, this goes the same to any other ZIPs you flash.

8.  Once finished, reboot to `system`. The phone will reboot into your Custom ROM.
